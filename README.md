# Code Challenges
Getting proficient in different programming languages:   
practices with code challenges
Possible programming language code cohabitation   
- Python [ with `unittest` and `pytest` ]
- JS [ WIP ]

## Installations
- For python dependencies
`pip install requirements.txt`

### Run test locally
Running test from the folder root terminal with python would require the following 
as they import code from a root relative level to this whole project

#### Python 
`python -m <foldername>.<filename>` or `pytest`
